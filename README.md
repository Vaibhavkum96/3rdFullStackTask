Question: Create a web application using Node.js and React .The application should have a basic UI with a list of users. When a user is selected, display a form to edit their information. When the form is submitted, update the user in the MongoDB database. 
Note-Display the results of node.js in the frontend using React.

Backend and Frontend have been created separately, api---> backend, client--> frontend, I have created all the API's and have tested them throughly. 
For the front End part I have created there separate Components EditUser, User, UserDetails which handles all the functionality which is provided in the question. 

Everything seems to be working for both the frontend and as well as the backend part.

TechStack: NodeJs, ExpressJs, ReactJs, MongoDb
