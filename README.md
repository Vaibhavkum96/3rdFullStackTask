Backend and Frontend have been created separately, api---> backend, client--> frontend, I have created all the API's and have tested them throughly. 
For the front End part I have created there separate Components EditUser, User, UserDetails which handles all the functionality which is provided in the question. 
I was able to successfully edit and save the data in the backend/MongoDb through React UI.

Everything seems to be working for both the frontend and as well as the backend part.

TechStack: NodeJs, ExpressJs, ReactJs, MongoDb
